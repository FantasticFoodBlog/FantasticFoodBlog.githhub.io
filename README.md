Today I made some melted chocolate! It's great on Rice Krispy Treats, Ritz crackers, and more! (It's also FANTASTIC just by itself!)
Here is how you make it:

### Melted Chocolate Recipe  
Makes about 1 serving  
Time: 5-10 minutes  
Difficulty level: Very easy  

Ingredients:  
1 Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar, small size (like is given out on Halloween)  

Equipment:  
Small bowl  
Microwave  
Spoon  

What you do:  
1. Take the wrapper off of the Hershey's Chocolate bar and break it into pieces along the lines. Put it in the bowl.  
2. Microwave it! Try starting with 20-30 seconds, check if it's melted, and then put it back in if it isn't. Continue doing this until when you poke the chocolate, it collapses a bit.  
3. Stir it constantly for about 30 seconds, or until "silky smooth".  <strong> It will look very clumpy, but as you stir it more and more, it WILL get smoother! </strong>  
4. Drizzle it, dip into it, or scoop it; enjoy your chocolate!!
