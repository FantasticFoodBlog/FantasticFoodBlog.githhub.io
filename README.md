### 1: Melted chocolate
Today I made some melted chocolate! It's great on Rice Krispy Treats, Ritz crackers, and more! (It's also FANTASTIC just by itself!)
Here is how you make it:

### Melted Chocolate Recipe  
Makes about 1 serving  
Time: 5-10 minutes  
Difficulty level: Very easy  

Ingredients:  
1 Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar, small size (like is given out on Halloween)  

Equipment:  
Small microwave-safe bowl  
Microwave  
Spoon  

What you do:  
1. Take the wrapper off of the Hershey's Chocolate bar and break it into pieces along the lines. Put it in the bowl.  
2. Microwave it! Try starting with 20-30 seconds, check if it's melted, and then put it back in if it isn't. Continue doing this until when you poke the chocolate, it collapses a bit.  
3. Stir it constantly for about 30 seconds, or until "silky smooth".  <strong> It will look very clumpy, but as you stir it more and more, it WILL get smoother! </strong>  
4. Drizzle it, dip into it, or scoop it; enjoy your chocolate!!  

### 2: The yummy scoop

Makes about 1 serving... but you might want more!  
Time: 5-10 minutes  
Difficulty level: Easy  

Ingredients:
1 teaspoon finely chopped KitKats  
1 teaspoon finely chopped Rice Krispy Treats  
A tiny bit (about a pinch) of sugar, more chopped KitKats or something else (this is optional)  

Equipment:
Small microwave-safe bowl  
Knife (I used a butter knife and it worked just fine)  
Microwave  
Spoon  

What you do:  
1. Chop up some KitKats and Rice Krispy treats, about 1 teaspoon of each. <em> Make sure that you chop them finely; that way the result will turn out better :) </em>  
2. Put them into a small bowl and mix them a little bit.
3. Microwave for 4 10-second intervals, stirring after the third and mashing it together after the fourth. <em> The time depends on your microwave, so that's just a rule of thumb. </em>  
4. With the spoon, mash the mixture down into your teaspoon. It should fit pretty well, as the mixture will have gone down from 2 teaspoons of ingredients to 1!
5. Scoop it out and put it back into the bowl or on a plate.
6. (optional) Dust with a little bit of sugar, chopped KitKats, or something else.
7. Enjoy!
