# Welcome to the Fantastic Food Blog!
## Here, I'll post recipes and other fun food stuff.
I like to create my own recipes, but you might find others here too.  
(Note: If I did not make the recipe myself, I <strong> will </strong> tell you who did!)

I've divided this blog into a bunch of different pages, and the first one is about some easy desserts that you can make in 5 or 10 minutes! Here is the link:
