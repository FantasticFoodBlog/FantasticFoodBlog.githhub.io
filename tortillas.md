# Here are some recipes that you can make using tortillas!

## 1: Hummus & Turkey pinwheels  
Makes 1 serving (but you could also share it, or just eat it yourself, and whichever way, you might want MORE!)   
Time: About 10 minutes  
Difficulty level: Easy  

Ingredients:  
1 tortilla  
Plain Hummus (about half of a 2.5 oz container)  
1-2 slice(s) of lunchmeat turkey

Equipment:  
Plate  
Butter knife  
Sharper knife for cutting it into pieces (using the buttter knife for this doesn't always turn out great...)  
Toothpicks (optional)  

What you do:  
1. Put the tortilla on the plate and cover it with an evenly spread layer of hummus.  
2. Put the turkey on top of it <em> Tip: Leave a small margin around the edge of just hummus and no turkey, or else when you go to roll it up, the turkey will peek out! </em>  
3. Roll it up! To do this, just take one end of it and roll toward the other end.  
4. Cut into smaller pieces (the "pinwheel" part of it).   
5. If desired, put toothpicks in each little roll-up.  
6. Enjoy! You can also leave it in one big tube instead of cutting it into pieces, and it's also great with chopped apple or pear.
